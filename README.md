# Or pull from Docker Hub
docker pull platypew/pwnpad:latest # Base image
docker pull platypew/pwnpad:extra  # Extra tools

    <h1>Features</h1>
    <p>Why PwnPad over other Docker-based environments?</p>
</div>
<br/>

1. It's powered by Arch (which means you have the power of the AUR)
2. It runs on MacOS and Linux (Windows using WSL2)
3. It runs Systemd as its init process (controversial, but here you go anyways)
4. It's built for both amd64 and arm64
5. It's super lightweight taking a little over 3GB of space (7.5GB for the extra image)
6. You can spawn as many instances as you want and remove them just as quick (does not pollute your system)
7. Supports X11 forwarding, which means you don't need the whole desktop environment just to run GUI programs when you can just forward it your host
8. Supports VNC and noVNC with i3, which means you have a super lightweight window manager
9. Customised Neovim and Zsh so you look _super_ cool using it

### Integrated Features

#### SSH

You can ssh into PwnPad by doing these steps.

1. `sudo systemctl start sshd`
2. Insert your public key into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
3. Use `p2 ls` to the port bound to port 22
4. Do `ssh -p <port> pwnpad@localhost`

#### Proxy

You can proxy your traffic through PwnPad by doing these steps.

. Use `p2 ls` to the port bound to port 22 2. `sshuttle -vHNr pwnpad@localhost:<port>`

#### Publish Port to Public

You can use ngrok to publish a port to the public.

-   Start: `publish start` (Insert api key if prompted)
-   Stop: `publish stop`
-   Status: `publish status`
-   Set a port to tunnel: `publish set <port>`
-   Delete a tunnelling port: `publish del <port>`

#### Toggle ASLR

You can turn ASLR on and off.

-   On: `aslr on`
-   Off: `aslr off`

#### Enable noVNC (only in extra image)

Enabling VNC (you may need to run your system through a proxy to access the noVNC server).

-   Start: `gui start`
-   Stop: `gui stop`

#### Create intel environment (only in arm64 image)

Creates a chroot environment to run purely intel binaries.
You can still run intel binaries that uses only glibc within the regular context.

-   Use pacman: `intel-pacman`
-   Run command: `intel-run`
